This study is unique in that it will be one of the first to evaluate a combined physical activity and nutrition intervention for youth that revolves around the primary health care setting. The PACE+ intervention is particularly innovative in that three components - computer, provider counseling, and an extended home-based intervention - are unified through a common theoretical framework.","brief_title":"PACE+: Counseling Adolescents for Exercise and Nutrition","detailed_description":"Improved physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviors in adolescents show great promise to reduce risk of cancers and other diseases. Fewer than 20% of adolescents meet recommendations for fat or fruits & vegetables consumption, and only 50% of adolescent girls and 67% of boys meet recommendations for vigorous PA. PACE+ will evaluate an integrated clinical and home-based intervention to improve physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviors in adolescents. The intervention has three integrated components: a computer assessment and action planner; provider counseling; and 24 months of extended phone & mail contact. 768 male and female adolescents age 11 through 15; will be recruited from six healthcare settings. Subjects will be randomly assigned within practices to two successive one-year \"doses\" of PACE+ or a comparison condition involving counseling for sun protection behaviors. PACE+ assesses four behaviors: 1) dietary fat, 2) fruits & vegetable consumption, 3) physical activity, and 4) sedentary behavior. Primary behavioral outcomes, secondary outcomes, and selected mediators and process variables will be measured prior to the first office visit and at 6, 12 and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be measured by the 7-day physical activity recall and 3-day food record of fruits & vegetables and fat at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include adiposity, fitness, BMI, psychosocial mediators of change, and body image. Potential risks are psychological and physical, however the risks are slight and of low likelihood. Benefits include helping bring about healthier lifestyles to prevent weight gain and reduce premature morbidity and mortality due to cancer, cardiovascular disease and other health problems.

Primary infection is defined by positive CMV IgM antibodies with absent or low titres of CMV IgG antibodies, and either low (<40%) CMV IgG avidity indexes with positive CMV IgM AND IgG antibodies. In addition women with indefinite avidity index and positive CMV DNA detection in urine and/or blood samples are also considered for treatment. Standard human intravenous immunoglobulins were chosen for their safety and efficacy, well documented in other settings. IVIGs were used to perform all of the infusions in the study, undiluted after reconstitution, in accordance with instructions of the manufacturer. We chose to perform IVIG infusions using 0.5 g/Kg of body weight, to make sure that a dose of specific CMV IgG at least comparable with that carried by HIG were infused at each time point. Infusions last 4 to 5 hours, using a double lumen line to infuse approximately 1500 mL of either 5% glucose or saline solution in parallel with the undiluted IVIG preparation, to reduce the risk of infusion reactions. CMV IgG and IgM antibodies and IgG avidity indexes are assayed before and after each IVIG infusion, within 15 minutes. Quantitative CMV DNA is amplified from whole blood and urine samples from pregnant women and neonates, using the Real-Time PCR, and on samples of amniotic fluid from women who required amniocentesis. The newborns will be followed for five years after delivery.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","brief_summary":"This overall research goal will be to develop a mobile-based module to improve glycemic control during the menstrual cycle in women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This module will run on an Android Operating System (OS) and will be available as: (i) a stand-alone application and (ii) an important additional component to a larger system, the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) - a mobile-based medical platform for diabetes applications. This proposal aims to build one such application or module targeting the improvement of diabetes control in younger women who experience glucose variation related to their menstrual cycle.","brief_title":"Development of an Advisory System for Glycemic Control During the Menstrual Cycle in Patient With Type 1 Diabetes","detailed_description":"The purpose of this particular protocol is to study the underlying glycemic variability across the menstrual cycle in women with T1DM. A subset of premenopausal women with T1DM experience loss of glucose control during the latter half of the cycle (the luteal phase). Clinical trials are sparse and tools are limited to focus on this aspect of diabetes care which is highly relevant in affected individuals. To obtain data to initialize this mobile-based module, we will enroll premenopausal women for approximately three-month outpatient study designed to characterize at least three complete menstrual cycles. These subjects will wear continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), record self-monitored blood glucoses (SMBGs) and utilize an insulin pump to capture insulin dosing. In-home ovulation kits will be used to determine relevant days for sex-steroid blood measurements to define menstrual cycle phases. Finally, structured at-home meals will be provided during different phases of the menstrual cycle for insulin action parameters assessments. The software module will be developed in parallel with the data collection from study subjects. The software module will not be used with the patients in this study as it is not in existence as would be developed in parallel. The goal of the module functionality will be to 1) assist patients and providers in the identification and management of glycemic variability surrounding the menstrual cycle and 2) add value to and become an integral module within the artificial pancreas.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Delirium","brief_summary":"The typical delirium study between 1989 and 2005 compared delirium management in a specialty unit such as geriatric medicine with delirium management in general medicine (in most cases the research diagnosis of delirium was not communicated to the general medicine group). This study will provide open diagnosis of delirium by the CAM to both the geriatric medicine and general medicine groups (medical staff, patients, families) plus daily monitoring of delirium using digit span and delirium index which is reported to both patient groups. It will also compare confusion assessment method (CAM)to a novel diagnostic system of Paul Regal with respect to hard endpoints (survival and return home). Hypotheses: 1) General medicine can manage delirium as well as geriatric medicine when delirium is openly diagnosed and monitored daily (even in speciality units it is rare to find daily measurement of tools such as delirium index); 2) The Regal diagnostic system will be superior to the CAM in predicting hard endpoints (survival and return home rate for patients living in the community).","brief_title":"Prospective Randomised Controlled Trial of Delirium Management by Geriatric Medicine Versus General Medicine","detailed_description":"Delirium research has been stuck in 1990 with the CAM. Articles appearing in 2012 could have been written in 1990. The CAM is riddled with logical fallacies such as 1) Circular reasoning about hearing loss causing delirium - hearing loss causes incorrect answers to questions on orientation and attention, leading to false positive diagnosis of delirium; 2) Circular reasoning on dementia causing delirium - dementia often does cause delirium but behavioral and psychological symptoms of delirium (BPSD) are the most common false positive diagnosis of delirium. CADIS (Central Coast Australia Delirium Intervention Study) will compare CAM+ to CAM- age 65+ in emergency department (prevalent delirium). Paul Regal has already shown that the 8% of 630 elderly he admitted from January 2011 to June 2012 who were CAM+ had the same survival (hospital, 90 day, 180 day and 12 month) and return home rate (65%) as 580 CAM negative elderly. The Regal criteria for delirium are completely novel. For every error in questions, the Regal system forces the examiner to determine if the error is due to poor hearing or cognitive impairment. A portable amplifier with headphones is used. The Regal methods uses recent records as the baseline for attention, memory and orientation questions. For example, an 83 year-old woman was assessed in memory clinic and had digit span forward 5/5 and 5/6; 5-word recall at 5 minutes in MoCA was 4/5; orientation was 10/10. Two months later she is admitted for RLL pneumonia and confusion. Digit span declined by 40% to 3/5, 5-word recall at 5 minutes declined by 100% to 0/5 and orientation declined by 40% to 6/10. There was no event during the two months such as stroke to explain this decline. Another novel feature of CADIS is follow-up by a blinded clinical nurse consultant at 30 and 90 days, 12 and 24 months for MoCA, Addenbrooke Cognitve Assessment and four tests from CANTABeclipse (Cambridge Cognition) touchscreen laptop. The hypothesis is that \"persistent delirium\" is due primarily to irreverible brain events such as ischemic stroke.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Aortic Valve Replacement","brief_summary":"The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of using bivalirudin instead of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR).

The primary outcome is to determine the prevalence of self-perceived unmet supportive care needs, as identified by the Supportive Care Needs Survey -Short Form (SCNS-SF), in people who have pain caused by their cancer or cancer treatment. Hypothesis- Patients with pain caused by their cancer or cancer treatments will report unmet needs, which will increase if their pain is uncontrolled or if they have breakthrough pain. Secondary Objectives- 1. To establish if other confounding factors -such as age, gender, marital status, diagnosis, educational level and treatment, are significant predictors in the reporting of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain. 2. To establish if there are any other symptoms, identified by the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale - Short Form (MSAS-SF), that are significant predictors in the reporting of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain. 3. To compare the prevalence and severity of self-perceived unmet supportive care needs between people who experience controlled pain, uncontrolled pain and breakthrough pain. 4.

Caloric stimulation involves cooling the ear canal with either water or a cooling probe to induce vestibular stimulation. This is a technique frequently performed as part of a neurologic exam. The current theory of how caloric vestibular stimulation regulates pain is by thermosensory disinhibition. Temperatures below 25 C activate both cold thermoreceptors (Aδ fibers) and also C-nociceptors. These inputs pass in the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus, where the C-fiber input goes to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the Aδ fiber input passes to the thermosensory cortex in the dorsal posterior insula (dpIns). It is proposed that CVS reduces central pain by activating the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. As this area is anatomically adjacent to dorsal posterior insula, it may cross-activate it to suppress the ACC, or given both these cortical areas share pathways in the brainstem this may be the mechanism by which pain is suppressed. Our team has successfully demonstrated arterial spin labeling (ASL), among other functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities, to capture functional changes in cerebral processing related to pain. This utilizes the principle that increases in cerebral blood flow to a specific region of the cortex is a marker for increased functioning of this region, conversely a decrease of blood flow to a specified region is a correlate of down regulation of this specific region. We propose that ASL will be able to capture functional changes associated with caloric vestibular stimulation and better delineate the etiology of the pain augmentation. All functional studies will be conducted on a 3 Tesla scanner equipped with an 8-element, receive-only head coil. Each subject will lay in a supine position on the MRI table with their head immobilized by foam padding and a chinstrap. Every study will begin by collecting high-resolution anatomical images using a three-dimensional spoiled GRASS (Gradient Recalled Acquisition in Steady State) sequence. These structural images will be used for placement of the functional images and for anatomical atlas transformation in the image processing. The perfusion-weighted images will be acquired with a pulsed arterial spin labeling (non-invasive) approach. Once the baseline perfusion weighted functional images have been attained a continual functional image acquisition sequence will begin. During this phase the subject will have a series of three 30 second cooled ear canal irrigations separated by 60 seconds. The water will be cooled to 18 degrees Celsius using an ice water combination and standard thermometer. The irrigation will be administered at 2cc per second (total of 30cc per ear over 30 seconds) via an MRI compatible infusion pump through a modified stethoscope with perforations to ensure there is no possibility of pressure build-up within the canal. Following this series, perfusion weighted images will be collected for a subsequent 10minutes. Subjects will be welcome to discontinue from the study at any time they see fit. Each functional study will comprise 24.5 minutes. 10 minutes of baseline imaging 5.5 minutes of initial functional imaging, 4.5 min of caloric vestibular stimulation and 5.5 minutes of repeat functional imaging. Images are to be reconstructed using software written in IDL (Interactive Data Language, Research Systems, Boulder, CO). Functional image pre-processing and statistical analyses will be performed with Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The end data will be a measurement, in percentage change, of blood flow to specific anatomic regions of the cortex.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Chemotherapy","brief_summary":"Aim of the study is to increase the proportion of indicated patients with colorectal cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection through an optimized symptom management and logistical support.","brief_title":"Supportive Cancer Care Networkers (SCAN)","detailed_description":"Patients with colorectal cancer in Germany today are exposed to several Problems related to care continuity and access to health care professionals. In order to increase the utilization of adjuvant therapies, patients in the intervention group are offered an additional nursing intervention in the period between discharge after inpatient treatment and the beginning of adjuvant therapy. This includes a telephone follow-up conducted according to guidelines serving to disclose patients' current supportive needs in order to determine potential intervention approaches as early as possible. Hence, the intervention aims to motivate patients not to discontinue the treatment. An early detection of therapy-related physical and psychological impairments aims at optimizing treatment management. Patients in the intervention group therefore are visited by nursing staff specialized in cancer care (Supportive Cancer Care Networkers, SCAN) during their in-patient stay and are informed about the intervention. An assignment for the SCAN is to support patients in getting access to health care services (e.g. specialists). Patients are given certain information, as for example contact to specialists, voluntary services and the next steps and appointments of the treatment plan are discussed. Within a consultation at the day before hospital discharge, the SCAN takes up the contact information and appoints weekly telephone consultations for the time up to the adjuvant therapy.

TTM is associated with significant impairments in social functioning and often has a profound negative impact on self- esteem and well being. Conservative estimates suggest that 0.6% percent of the US population, or about 1.8 million people, meet full diagnostic criteria for TTM and approximately 7.5 million US residents have significant hair pulling problems. Of those treated, 60% to 70% are wholly or partially refractory to standard behavioral and pharmacological treatments and could therefore potentially benefit from this device. Best practice treatment for TTM involves a form of behavioral therapy known as habit reversal therapy (HRT). HRT requires persons with TTM to be aware of their hair pulling behaviors, yet the majority of persons with TTM pull most of their hair outside of their awareness. HRT also requires TTM sufferers to record the frequency and duration of their hair pulling behaviors yet it is impossible for a person to monitor behaviors that they are unaware of. Our Phase I efforts have produced a prototype device (AEMD) that solves these two problems. The prototype AEMD signals the TTM sufferer if their hand approaches their hair, thereby bringing pulling-related behavior into awareness. The prototype AEMD also logs the time, date, duration, and user classification of hair pulling related events. Our published pilot study and subsequent investigations establish that the prototype AEMD successfully alerts TTM sufferers to pulling-related behaviors and monitors TTM-related behavior in a laboratory setting. With respect to technological innovation, this project has the potential to develop the first available miniaturized, wearable, patient interactive, real-time data collecting and proximity-sensing device that both alerts sufferers to the presence of mental illness symptoms as they occur and keeps track of the frequency and intensity of the problem. The patented technologies developed for the AEMD have the potential to be of great value for a range of other health/mental health conditions or industrial applications. Our overall Phase II aim is to further refine the AEMD and to evaluate its acceptance and utility when used in an open trial course of professionally-led habit reversal therapy. It is hypothesized that the AEMD will be enthusiastically accepted by TTM sufferers and their clinicians and that it will perform as designed during the clinical trial. The Phase II AEMD will include a bracelet(s)/watch to be worn on each wrist, another element to be placed at the rear base of the neck, and a pager-like alert device to be worn at the belt-line or in a pocket. The AEMD, if found to be useful and effective, has the potential to significantly reduce the symptoms of TTM and its associated functional impairments. The AEMD also has great potential to improve assessment and monitoring of TTM behaviors which could be invaluable to clinicians planning treatment and to researchers evaluating the efficacy of various treatment strategies. We discovered that the electronic monitoring capability of the AEMD did not function properly. Therefore we cannot report time spent pulling using the electronic device. We relied on self-report instruments to assess the impact of the psychotherapy combined with with the device on the severity of trichotillomania.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"NOT FOUND","brief_summary":"NOT FOUND","brief_title":"[Trial of device that is not approved or cleared by the U.S. FDA]","detailed_description":"NOT FOUND","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Depression","brief_summary":"This multi-center, 2-arm interventional study within different mental health care settings (psychiatry: in-patient, day-unit and out-patient, as well as psychiatric rehabilitation) evaluates a psychotherapeutic group intervention to improve stigma coping and empowerment using a psychotherapeutic module embedded in a psychoeducational group therapy.","brief_title":"Group Intervention for Improving Stigma Coping and Empowerment of People With Mental Illness (STEM)","detailed_description":"People with mental illness suffer both from the burden of disease itself and from the social stigma related to mental illness, hence impeding their treatment (Sartorius et al. 2005, Link et al. 1999). Negative attitudes towards and discriminating behavior against people with mental illness negatively affect health care utilization, the course of disease, compliance, self-esteem, and social functioning (Sirey et al. 2001, Link et al. 2001, Perlick et al. 2001). Internalizing negative social stereotypes (self-stigmatization; Ritsher et al. 2003, Watson et al. 2007) impairs the quality of life and leads to social withdrawal (Rüesch 2005). Furthermore, self stigma is associated with lower empowerment (Ritsher et al. 2004), a poorer social network (Lysaker et al. 2007), lower compliance (Fung et al. 2008) and a higher extent of symptoms (Corrigan et al. 2006). The stigma of mental illness leads to an impaired pursuance of individual life goals, as job-related ambitions or living in a relationship (Rüesch 2005). Current approaches targeting the stigma of mental illness primarily focus on education about mental illness in different target groups (e.g. Gaebel et al. 2003, 2004) and can be successful, if appropriately implemented (Gaebel et al. 2008). Yet there is a lack of RCT-tested psychotherapeutic approaches which directly address patients with mental illness improving their skills of coping with stigma and discrimination. Therefore it is intended to develop, manualise, and to evaluate such a psychotherapeutic group intervention within a randomized clinical control group design. In this context, group-based cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy has been proved as efficient therapeutic approach for patients with depression (cf. McDermut et al. 2006) and with schizophrenia (cf. Lawrence et al. 2006, Barrowclough et al. 2006) in different settings. Patients can serve each other as role models and will modify negative self-related cognitions, thus developing new cognitions supporting self-esteem (Corrigan et al. 2001). The following interventional effects should improve the patients' quality of life and also result in a reduction of frequency and length of inpatient stays and sickness-related absenteeism: - improved skills to cope with negative stigmatizing experiences, - a reduced burden through of self-stigmatizing cognitions, - a better utilization of resources for disease managing in coherence with reduced self-stigmatization, and - an improved coping with stigma-related conflicts at work.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Wounds and Injuries","brief_summary":"The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation, using wire leads, to produce an effective cough in patients with spinal cord injuries.","brief_title":"Stimulation With Wire Leads to Restore Cough","detailed_description":"Patients with cervical spinal cord injuries often have paralysis of a major portion of their expiratory muscles — the muscles responsible for coughing — and therefore, lack a normal cough mechanism. Consequently, most of these patients suffer from a markedly reduced ability to clear airway secretions, a factor which contributes to the development of recurrent respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Expiratory muscles can be activated by electrical stimulation of the spinal roots to produce a functionally effective cough. The purpose of this trial is to determine if electrical stimulation of the expiratory muscles by wire leads is capable of producing an effective cough on demand. According to the trial researchers, if successful, this technique will prevent the need for frequent patient suctioning — which often requires the constant presence of trained personnel. It will also allow spinal cord injured patients to clear their secretions more readily, thereby reducing the incidence of respiratory complications and associated illness and death. In the trial, researchers will study 16 adults (18-75 years old) with cervical spinal injuries (C8 level or higher), at least 6 months following the date of injury. After an evaluation of medical history, a brief physical examination, and initial testing, participants will have wire leads placed — by a routine, minimally invasive surgical procedure — over the surface of their spinal cords on the lower back to stimulate the expiratory muscles and restore cough.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Health Communication","brief_summary":"The aim of this study is to determine whether multimedia based health information presented in a pediatric acute ward to parents of children with breathing difficulties due to lower respiratory tract infections, is more effective than verbal information to reduce the parent's anxiety and to increase satisfaction with nursing care and health information.","brief_title":"Multimedia Based Information to Parents in a Pediatric Acute Ward: A Randomized Controlled Trial","detailed_description":"The intervention website www.syktbarn.no is an open Norwegian online resource for parents of small children, and the site contains videos, audio clips, animations, illustrations, pictures and text materials regarding children's illnesses and normal development.

Approximately 4% of youth in the United States have a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD and a Learning Disability (ADHD/LD). Research has shown ADHD/LD symptoms persist into young adulthood, a time when many are enrolled in post-secondary education. Students with ADHD/LD at the post-secondary education level constitute an emergent subgroup of the ADHD and LD populations that have received far less attention in the literature compared to children, adolescents and employed adults. The actual percentage of college students with ADHD/LD is unknown; however, some estimates suggest that 2-8% of students attending post secondary education have ADHD, LD or both. Youth with the additive problems of both disorders are at high risk for academic failure, and poor psychosocial and occupational outcomes in adulthood. The \"multiple deficit model\" suggests that there is a common genetic and neuropsychological underpinning to these disorders. For example, ADHD and LD share similar features, such as core deficits in processing speed and working memory. ADHD and LD are each associated with several cognitive difficulties including poor working memory (WM) and processing speed. WM is a \"mental workspace\" that provides temporary storage and manipulation of information and is closely related to g, a proposed measure of general cognitive ability. In addition, WM has also been found to predict academic achievement. One major problem is that current intervention approaches for ADHD/LD do not target the underlying cognitive deficits fundamental to these diagnoses. Thus, interventions that address underlying cognitive difficulties, such as WM, are a promising avenue of additional treatment for youth with combined ADHD/LD. WM capacity has generally been thought to be a fixed trait, but recent studies have suggested that it can be improved by intensive and adaptive computerized training. This intervention approach has been evaluated in children and adolescents with ADHD, older adults, and adult stroke patients and shown promising results. Subjects not only improved on the trained WM tasks, but some of the studies suggest that improvements may generalize to non-trained WM activities, complex reasoning tasks, academic functioning, and behavioral symptoms of ADHD or working memory failure. Moreover, brain imaging studies have provided converging evidence of training-related improvements in working memory: specifically increased activation has been found in cortical regions implicated in working memory. However, no studies to date have investigated whether WM capacity can be improved in a population of young adults with ADHD/LD enrolled in post-secondary education programs. Nor have the results been replicated or elaborated upon using different imaging methodologies, like EEG (Electroencephalography), which is able to capture the millisecond time parameters of cognitive processing and so may provide new insights into the neural mechanism of WM and effects of WM training. The overall objective of the current study is to determine the effectiveness of WM training, as administered by community-based psychologists licensed to provide this training, for college students with ADHD/LD. Specific objectives are to determine whether; i) standard-length computerized WM training enhances WM capacity in college students with ADHD/LD, using behavioral as well as neuro-imaging indices of change; ii) shortened-length WM training would also result in improvements in WM; iii) WM training normalizes WM performance, as compared to typically developing peers (i.e., a healthy comparison group of college students); iv) improvements in WM will generalize to secondary outcome tasks, such as inhibitory control and planning; v) WM training will also ameliorate ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity; and vi) improvements will be sustained for at least a few months after completing the training.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Androgenetic Alopecia","brief_summary":"This study aim to compare cosmetic results between 3 trichophytic closure techniques for donor site (the trimming of upper, lower and both edge of linear incision) in hair transplantation.","brief_title":"Split Wound Comparison of Trichophytic Closure Techniques for Donor Site in Hair Transplantation","detailed_description":"Strip harvesting technique, a conventional hair transplantation procedure, is widely used in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia for more than half a century. It provides less time-consuming, more feasible and more cost-effective comparing with follicular unit extraction (FUE) technique. However, linear scar at the donor site is also introduced. The latest method to fine the scar at the donor site was invented and known as 'Trichophytic closure technique'. It can be done by trimming upper or lower wound edge for about 1 millimeter (as Fig.1) before wound closure. Then the linear scar will be less visible after hair growth. Anyway, there is no exactly wound edge (upper, lower or both) that recommended for the excellent cosmetic results without any severe side effects. Therefore, this study was designed to determine which is the best trichophytic closure technique. This research is a pilot, split-wound comparison study of trichophytic closure techniques for donor site in hair transplantation.10 males, aged ≥ 25 years, who require strip harvesting follicular unit transplantation in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia will be enrolled.

The proposed method could become a recommended and simple intervention especially for individuals with limited access and poor tolerance to exercise. The rationale is based on the evidence that individuals with SCI experience decline in anabolic hormones which may be responsible for the deterioration in body composition and metabolic profiles and leads to increase obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and subsequently cardiovascular disease. The designed study will provide explanation to the adaptations in the energy source of the muscle cells in response to training.","brief_title":"Resistance Training and Testosterone After Spinal Cord Injury","detailed_description":"Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at a lifelong risk of increasing obesity and several chronic metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia secondary to deterioration in body composition. Within few weeks of injury, there are significant decrease in whole body fat-free mass (FFM), particularly lower extremity skeletal muscle mass and subsequent increase in fat mass (FM). Resistance training (RT) is an important type of exercise that has been shown to induce positive physiological adaptations such as increasing lean mass and reducing metabolic disorders in other clinical populations. In a pilot work, the investigators provided evidence that evoked RT using surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for knee extensor muscle group resulted in significant increase skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), reduction in % leg FM and a trend towards decrease in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) CSA. The favorable adaptations in body composition were associated with decrease in plasma insulin area under the curve and plasma triglycerides. The investigators attributed the adaptations in body composition and metabolic profile to an associated increase in plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). The investigators concluded that twelve weeks of evoked RT targeted towards evoking skeletal muscle hypertrophy could result in significant body composition and metabolic adaptations in individuals with SCI. It is unclear if a longer RT program greater than 12 weeks would provide additional benefits to Veterans with SCI. It is also unknown whether enhancing the decline anabolic homeostasis by providing testosterone (T) replacement therapy (TRT) would reverse body composition and metabolic profile changes in Veterans with SCI. The major research goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of 16 weeks of evoked RT+TRT vs. TRT on body composition (muscle CSA, VAT, %FM) and the metabolic profiles (glucose and lipid metabolism) in individuals with motor complete SCI. To address this goal, surface NMES accompanied with ankle weights will be conducted twice weekly to exercise the knee extensor skeletal muscle groups from sitting position. After 4 weeks of delayed entry approach, participants (n =24) will be randomly assigned into RT+TRT (n =12) or TRT (n =12) groups. The TRT will be provided via transdermal T patches that will be alternated on both shoulders over the course of the study. The investigators also propose to study the effects of detraining on body composition and metabolic profiles. The research plan includes three specific aims Specific aim 1 will demonstrate the effects of NMES RT and/or Testosterone patches (Tp) on the CSA of thighs and legs skeletal muscle groups, percentage FFM, and the CSA of VAT, intramuscular fat and percentage FM after 16 weeks of training+Tp and 16 weeks of detraining. Specific aim 2 will determine the changes in metabolic milieu (resting energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, free fatty acids, serum total and free testosterone and IGF-1), and cytokines (c-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 as inflammatory biomarkers) after 16 weeks of training+Tp and detraining. Specific aim 3 will determine if 16 weeks of evoked RT and Tp will increase GLUT-4 concentration, muscle IGF-1 and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 (PGC-1) expressions, altered fiber type distribution and enhance the mitochondrial enzymatic activities (electron transport chain) compared to Tp only.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Hepatocellular Carcinoma","brief_summary":"Our long-term objective is to develop a new tool based on a (molecular-biology) integrated imaging technology able to characterize and categorize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in need of liver transplant (LT).

The Dry Mouth Questionnaire (DMQ) was used to evaluate xerostomia levels before and after product/placebo application. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flows rates, before and after application, were measured.","brief_title":"Drug-induced Xerostomia. Evaluation of Malic Acid 1%, Salivary Mucins and Buffering Capacity","detailed_description":"- Patients and study Design The study was approved by the University of Granada Research Ethics Committee (Spain). All measurements and interventions were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of each participant according to Helsinki II Agreement.The study was designed as a double-blind randomized clinical trial following guidelines established by The Consort Statement (http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/). All study participants were recruited from the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Granada (Spain)at Drug Interactions in Dentistry clinical practice, between September and December 2011. Recruitment was supervised by research assistants. All participants had a full medical history and saliva samples were collected at the Faculty of Dentistry of University of Granada (Spain) at the Pharmacological Investigation in Dentistry Research Group laboratory (CTS-654). Sample size determination was based on the standard deviation of the main variable: the Dry Mouth Questionnaire (DMQ)was tested to determine the minimum sample size necessary to reliably confirm the hypothesis that a topical 1% malic acid sialogogue spray, combined with xylitol and fluoride, is effective for the treatment of xerostomia induced by antidepressant drugs over a two-week period. DMQ and saliva collection were measured the same day and by the same investigator. - Clinical Intervention Once the participants had signed the informed consent form and anamnesis had been carried out, the following question was asked to every patient: \"How often do you feel dry mouth?\" Available answers were: \"never\", \"sometimes\", \"usually\" or \"always.\" Those who answered \"usually\" or \"always\" were considered as suffering from xerostomia. Our clinical intervention among the intervention group subjects was the delivery to the patients of a topical sialogogue, containing 1% malic acid, xylitol 10% and fluoride0.05%(Xeros Dentaid Spray©, Dentaid, Barcelona, Spain) for two weeks, whereas a control group was given a placebo with the same presentation and composition (excepting 1% malic acid). Randomization was performed using the website http://www.randomization.com, obtaining a randomization plan, which assigned participants to either the intervention group or the control group. This randomization plan was delivered to a person unrelated to the study in order to prevent both participants and researchers from identifying the product.Both sprays were transferred by foreign personnel into two identical opaque flasks(without any brand name)labeled A and B containing respectively, either 1% malic acid or placebo.A code for randomization was kept in an opaque envelope in a safe environment and opened only at the end of the study. Data were analyzed by a third party blinded to the allocation results. 1% malic acid/placebo sprays were applied on demand, with a maximum of eight doses per day. No participants left the trial. - Dry Mouth Questionnaire (DMQ) The DMQ, developed by Vissink et al., Gravenmade et al., van der Reijden et al. and Regelink et al. was used in order to obtain subjective information about the severity of xerostomia before and after treatment with malic acid/placebo. Every participant answered an initial questionnaire (DMQ 1) about the symptoms related to oral dryness, before receiving a spray (1% malic acid or placebo). After two weeks of applications, patients had to answer DMQ 1 again as well as an additional questionnaire (DMQ 2) about the efficacy of the sprays. Increased DMQ scores indicate improvement of xerostomia. DMQ 1 was used to assess the initial severity of oral dryness and in particular its impact on oral function: problems when chewing, swallowing, speaking and general impact on daily life. DMQ 1 used a 0-to-4 rating scale where 0 = \"very dry\" and 4 = \"not dry at all.\" After two weeks of treatment, DMQ 1 was repeated. DMQ 2 was designed to assess the impact of the spray on the symptoms of xerostomia, and was also based on a 0-to-4 rating scale where 0 = frequent restriction of oral function and 4= no restriction of oral function/no feeling of oral dryness. The effect of the frequency and duration of spray applications in the oral cavity were also registered. - Sialometries As secondary measurements, both unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates were assessed in all patients. The unstimulated salivary flow rate was obtained by the spit method every 30 seconds for 15 minutes. Saliva was collected in 20 mL plastic containers, which were pre-weighted (in 0.001 g) using a precision scale. Measurements were expressed as mL/min. Stimulated whole saliva was obtained by chewing a 1 g piece of paraffin wax for six minutes. Saliva collected during the first minute was discarded, and then collected into the container every 30 seconds. Both DMQ and sialometries were always assessed at the same time of day (from 09:00 to 11:00 a.m.) to avoid any circadian variation. Before the evaluation, participants were asked not to eat, drink, smoke or brush their teeth for one hour prior to their appointment at the clinic.Time passed between the last use of the sialogogue and the salivary flow measurements was 6 hours.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Breast Cancer","brief_summary":"Select patients of primary breast cancer whose hormone receptor is positive and accepted postoperative adjuvant aromatase inhibitors for endocrine treatment.Treat them with zoledronic acid 4mg intravenous infusion every six months until the end of the aromatase treatment.

METHODS: The investigators performed a prospective study through randomization of 77 patients undergoing short surgical procedures in two study groups: one received a mixture of ketamine-propofol in a 1:1 ratio, and the other received a 1:2 mixture. Data were stored in an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using the statistical program Epi-Info (TM) 3.5.3. The investigators performed the comparison of qualitative and quantitative variables. KEY WORDS: ketamine, propofol, anesthesia.","brief_title":"Efficacy of Ketamine-Propofol for Short Surgical Procedures","detailed_description":"In recent years there has been particular interest in ketamine-propofol for sedation of patients who are candidates for short minimally invasive surgical procedures. In some centers in Canada and the U.S. is, in fact, the first choice of sedation in the ED. There are also publications of their usefulness for pediatric procedures, interventional radiology, hematology, oncology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, CABG, burn patients, gastroenterology, etc.; its benefits as mixed anesthetic technique in patients with neuraxial anesthesia are recognized. Around this, the literature is generous to provide us with evidence to use it in our daily practice. There is no precise definition of what the ketofolis. Generally refers to the 50:50 mixture of ketamine and propofol, 0.5 mg / kg of each. However, a broader definition considered that ketofol is the combination of ketamine and propofol, regardless of the ratio to each other (the initial dose of each can be scaled up to 3 mg / kg). When they are used in infusion, the dose is 100μg/kg/min. The combination of ketamine and propofol offers advantages from a theoretical viewpoint, and as already shown, from a clinical standpoint. Ketamine-propofol technique simulates the conditions of general anesthesia because the patient is still unconscious, and although they should be available for when needed, saves anesthetic equipment as endotracheal tubes, laryngeal masks, anesthesia machine, etcetera. Avoid also the risk of malignant hyperthermia by halogenated because the patient is not exposed to pure technical inhalation or balanced techniques. Guitar proposed the ketamine-propofol mixture in 1991, however, was Friedberg who first published his benefits March 26, 1992. Friedberg was based on the technique of Vinnik using ketamine-diazepam for outpatient cosmetic procedures performed in the office. Ketamine is an aryl cyclohexamine (2-0-chlorophenyl-2-methylamino cyclohexanone) synthesized in 1961, with sedative, amnesic and analgesic properties, acting as NMDA receptor antagonist and agonist μ and σ opioid receptors. It starts to act at the first minute after intravenous application. Its duration of action is 15-30 min intravenously; the elimination half-life is 2-3 hours. Is soluble in water and lipophilic, which allows its administration by multiple routes. At low doses is primarily an analgesic and mild sedative, at higher doses produced a catatonic dissociated state which level of sedation is not increased with subsequent doses. Ketamine should be dosed based on ideal body weight and infused in 1 to 2 minutes. It has been used extensively in health institutions with limitations for patient monitoring or limitations to address advanced airway devices, because it preserves airway reflexes, indeed, patients can swallow even if they are completely dissociated. Ketamine also increases blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand by stimulating the cardiovascular tone by inhibiting the reuptake of catecholamines centrally. Ketamine is a respiratory stimulant, but may cause transient respiratory depression and even apnea during the first 3 minutes of administration. This problem is most often observed when the drug is administered rapidly or in association with other respiratory depressants such as benzodiazepines. It also produced laryngospasm in 0.4% of a large series of patients, so initially was contraindicated for intraoral procedures, but today it is still used for dental procedures. Of the 11,589 children in the meta-analysis of Green who were administered ketamine, only 2 (0.017%) required intubation for laryngospasm. Other adverse effects of ketamine include feelings of dissociation from the body, unpleasant dreams, hallucinations or illusions, delusions, etc. Produces electrophysiological dissociation between neocortex, thalamus and limbic system, stimulation of the hippocampus and other subcortical nuclei, or the depression of the visual and auditory nuclei, which would lead to the misperception of external stimuli. The emergent phenomenon, known as dysphoric reaction on waking from anesthesia induced by ketamine, can occur in up to 20% of cases. Sedatives, counseling and music have proven to reduce the occurrence of these reactions. Vomiting occurs in 5 to 15% of patients emerging from a dissociative state. A rash may appear immediately after injection of ketamine that resolves spontaneously within 20 minutes, and does not use in subsequent administrations. The salivation is a common problem in children so antisialagogues are imperative; this is less common in adults, and the use of antisialagogues may slightly increase the incidence of adverse respiratory events. In dissociative doses, ketamine produces a reliable analgesia. It is the only intravenous anesthetic with properties such as amnesia, sedation and analgesia that make of ketamine the only intravenous anesthetic that can be used alone to provide anesthesia. However, repetitive use and higher doses induces tolerance. In its favor is the high margin of safety: Strayer & Nelson reviewed over 70000 patients, and only documented one significant cardiorespiratory event attributed to ketamine. It was felt for a long time that ketamine was contraindicated in patients with traumatic brain injury, but evidence now suggests that those patients may benefit because ketamine preserves cerebral blood flow. Ketamine also elevates intraocular pressure: it should be avoided in patients with glaucoma. Also is contraindicated in psychosis and hyperthyroidism. The 2.6 diisopropylphenol, also known as propofol, is an alkyl with pure sedative action. It was first used widely as a hypnotic by 1986, achieving great popularity for its rapid onset of action and short half-life effectiveness. Its onset of action is less than one minute and duration of 5 to 15 minutes. It can be administered only by intravenous bolus only for short procedures or infusions for longer procedures. Lean body weight (ideal weight corrected in the morbidly obese) must be used to calculate the initial bolus, and real weight to calculate the maintenance dose. Propofol is prepared as a lipid emulsion containing soy lecithin and egg, with the potential for allergic reactions in people sensitive to these components. The lipid emulsion promotes bacterial growth, so that the vial must be protected to avoid contamination. The low pH causes burning pain when applied, that is why it is coadministered with lidocaine to reduce pain of injection. Its mechanism of action is based on the potentiation of the GABA receptor activity and sodium channel blockade. Propofol has no analgesic action, so it is necessary to achieve deep sedation for painful procedures, exposing the patient to their respiratory depressant and hypotensive effects (desaturation and apnea) at the doses required to produce adequate sedation. Induces transient hypoxia in the 5 to 20% of patients, and 10-25% decrease in mean arterial pressure. Its use is safe, with a documented need for CPR in 2 of 49,836 patients. Agitation, tachycardia, confusion and hallucinations secondary to the use of propofol can be reversed with the use of physostigmine. There is not agent to reverse the hypnotic effects of propofol. The combination of ketamine and propofol seeks to limit the adverse effects of each of the two drugs, and synergize their analgesic, hypnotic and sedative effects because they use less dose of each to achieve the same anesthetic and cardiovascular effects. Seven studies support the concept of synergy because similar quality of anesthesia was achieved with lower doses of propofol and ketamine. Propofol is an excellent sedative but has no analgesic effects. Hypotension and respiratory depression of propofol may be offset by the sympathomimetic effects of ketamine. Eight studies confirm the protective effect of ketamine on propofol-induced hypotension. Vomiting and hallucinations of ketamine can be reduced by antiemetic and hypnotic effects of propofol. Propofol reduces dysphoric reactions of ketamine, in some cases to zero. There have been multiple schemes, dose and proportions in the mixture of ketamine-propofol. Is not entirely clear, however, what proportion of ketamine-propofol is better. Willman and Andolfatto used a proportion 1: 1, meaning that for each mg of ketamine they administered 1 mg of propofol, obtaining satisfactory results for the patient, and highly effective in achieving the therapeutic goal. But our question is if different proportions of this mixture can produce the same sedative benefits with better secondary effects profile. This study was based on a ratio 1:2 (1 mg of ketamine per 2 mg of propofol) compared with a 1:1 ratio mixture in patients who went for short minimally invasive procedures and see if they had fewer adverse effects. Sharieff et al used already ketamine-propofol combination in a 1:2 ratio in a small group of 20 pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design It was a randomized, controlled, prospective study in patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures of less than an hour. Informed consent was obtained from each of the admitted patients. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cartagena. Setting and population The study was conducted in two tertiary care academic institutions. Patients who met selection criteria were randomized (according to a table of random numbers generated on the website: http://stattrek.com/tables/random.aspx) to be assigned to one of the two research groups, between March and September 2011. Study Protocol During the study period, one researcher was responsible for selecting and inviting patients to be part of the study in the area for the preparation of patients before entering surgery. Once patients nodded in their participation, the informed consent were read and explained, which must be signed before assigning the patient to one of the groups. Later the patient was conducted to the operating room. One anesthesia machine connected to a source of 100% oxygen was available, as well as devices for handling non-invasive and invasive airway (nasal cannula, face masks for all sizes, Guedel cannula, laryngoscope with Macintosh and Miller blades of all sizes, orotracheal tubes of all sizes and laryngeal masks of all sizes). Also there were additional anesthetic drugs in case the anesthesiologist required inducing a deep anesthetic plane, or if required the rapid securing the airway with advanced devices. There was always at least one researcher (senior resident) in the operating room who was on charge of providing the medications, and monitor and record the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. The researcher was careful to correct any anesthetic complication that arises in the course of surgery. The following were the inclusion criteria: 1. Patient scheduled for minimally invasive procedures of less than an hour: reduction of dislocations and fractures, lavage and debridement of ulcers, drainage of abscesses, removal of osteosynthesis material, hernia umbilical, thoracotomies, circumcision, curettage, suturing tissue soft, burn care, etc. 2. Patients who have not eaten solid food within 8 hours before, or liquids in the two hours before 3. Be an adult or emancipated minor The following were the exclusion criteria: 1. An acute lung infection 2. Procedures involving stimulation of the posterior pharynx 3. Coronary heart disease, CHD, and angina or suspected aortic dissection 4. History of uncontrolled hypertension or BP> 140/90mmHg 5. Injury cerebral focal neurological deficit or loss of consciousness 6. Mass in CNS, hydrocephalus or other conditions with increased intracranial pressure. 7. Glaucoma or eye damage 8. History of porphyrias 9. Prior hyperthyroidism or thyroid hormone replacement 10. Pregnancy or lactation Major psychiatric disorder 11. Previous mild allergic reaction to ketamine, propofol, lidocaine, or egg albumin 12. Patient who refuses to provide informed consent After random assignment to study group, patients were given one of the following two combinations: 1. Anesthesia-sedation KETOFOL 1-1: 1 mg of ketamine per 1 mg of propofol. 2. Anesthesia-sedation KETOFOL 1-2: 1 mg of ketamine per 2 mg of propofol. Then the duration of the procedure was set to determine whether the patient would require bolus only (patients whose procedure lasted less than 10 minutes) or bolus and infusion (patients whose procedure lasted more than 10 minutes): <10 minutes The solution was prepared in a 20 cc syringe with: KETOFOL 1-1: - Propofol: 0.2 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 2mg/kg) - Ketamine: 0.04 cc / kg (50mg/cc = 2mg/kg) - 1% Lidocaine simple: 0.1 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 1mg/kg) KETOFOL 1-2: - Propofol: 0.2 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 2mg/kg) - Ketamine: 0.02 cc / kg (50mg/cc = 1mg/kg) - 1% Lidocaine simple: 0.1 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 1mg/kg) The allocated solution was administered at a minimum of three minutes to reduce to a minimum the incidence of respiratory depression. If the patient did not reach an adequate level of sedation / anesthesia, the patient received additional boluses every three minutes like this: KETOFOL 1-1: - Propofol: 0.1 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 1mg/kg) - Ketamine: 0.02 cc / kg (50mg/cc = 1mg/kg) KETOFOL 1-2: - Propofol: 0.1 cc / kg (10mg/cc = 1mg/kg) - Ketamine: 0.01 cc / kg (50mg/cc = 0.5 mg / kg) > 10 minutes These patients also required the initial bolus, and then an infusion of the same mixture of drugs started. The bolus dose was prepared similarly to as described above, and infusion solutions were prepared as follows: KETOFOL 1-1: In a volume of 100cc: - 20 cc of propofol (10mg/cc = 200mg total) - 4 cc of ketamine (50mg/cc = 200mg total) - 10 cc 1% lidocaine simple (10mg/cc = 100 mg total) - 66 cc 0.9% SSN KETOFOL 2-1: In a volume of 100cc: - 20 cc of propofol (10mg/cc = 200mg total) - 2 cc of ketamine (50mg/cc = 100mg total) - 10 cc 1% lidocaine simple (10mg/cc = 100 mg total) - 0.9% SSN 68 cc The volumes administered were as follows: Ketofol 1-1: Bolus in three minutes and immediately begins the infusion to 0.03 cc / kg / min (60 μgr / kg / min of ketamine + 60 μgr / kg / min of propofol). Ketofol 1-2: Bolus in three minutes and immediately begins the infusion to 0.03 cc / kg / min (30 μgr / kg / min of ketamine + 60 μgr / kg / min of propofol). The infusions were suspended 5 minutes before the end of the surgical procedure. The data were stored in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for tabulation and analysis by one of the researchers behind the study. Measurements The doses of the drugs used were administered by ideal weight corrected (ideal weight + 40% of the difference between actual weight and ideal weight). The satisfaction of patients and surgeons was evaluated in a 5-item scale: extremely satisfied, very satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, dissatisfied and very dissatisfied. Sedation / analgesia was considered successful if the procedure was completed without the need for other anesthetic drugs different from the protocol, and no adverse effects obliged the suspension of the procedure. Apnea was defined as cessation of breathing for at least 20 seconds. Hypotension was defined as 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure. Bradycardia was defined as a pulse of less than two standard deviations below normal values defined by the American Heart Association (AHA_ for its acronym in Ingles_). Hypoxia was defined by an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using Epi-Info (TM) 3.5.3. LIMITATIONS Within the constraints of the study is the limited sample size could have influenced the study's inability to achieve statistical significance in the differences obtained for most of the evaluated parameters between the two groups. Ketofol was not compared with other regimens of sedation, analgesia, and therefore cannot make any representations regarding its safety and efficacy faced with other schemes. The study was not applied to the pediatric population, which responds favorably to the administration of ketamine. Adverse effect was recorded as any manifestation of agitation, pain, nausea, etc., regardless of severity, which may exaggerate the incidence of adverse events of ketamine-propofol combination.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease","brief_summary":"The aim of the study is to validate the Korean version of Walking Impairment Questionnaire in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.","brief_title":"Validation of the Korean Version of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease","detailed_description":"First, the original version of WIQ will be translated into Korean, then it will be translated into English, again.

Specifically, the primary aim of this project is to evaluate whether novel habituation reminders (HRs) introduced following personally-relevant emotional stressors reduce acute negative emotions and psychological distress outside of an original learning context. Using a team of basic and applied scientists, over 4 years the investigators expect to screen 420 adult outpatients to enroll 250 study participants who have extreme difficulties with emotion regulation. These 250 participants will be randomly assigned to one of eight experimental groups, with the experimental design leading them through 1 or 2 of 3 project experiments. Actual enrollment: 372 adult outpatients signed consent and enrolled into the study. 222 participants were eligible and began the study. Out of the 222, 210 completed the study (as opposed to the desired 250). Experiment 1 will evaluate whether novel auditory HRs following personally-relevant emotional stressors differentially reduce psychological distress and negative emotions (via self-report and psychophysiology), compared to no HRs, within the same and different lab contexts after a 1 week delay. Experiment 2 will evaluate whether HRs differentially reduce negative emotions, psychological distress, difficulties with emotion regulation, and psychiatric symptoms, compared to sham sounds outside the laboratory across a 1 week period, using 8x daily assessments of distress and emotions and automated HRs/shams when acute negative emotions are present. An automated server and cellular phone system will be used to assess distress and emotional states and to deliver HRs/shams. Experiment 3 will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect size estimates when participants self-initiate the use of HRs in their daily lives across a 2 week period when acute negative emotions are present. The specific randomization rules across the 8 groups are explained in detail in the full protocol . Risks in this study may arise from 1) the assessment interviews and questionnaires, and 2) discussing and hearing self-reported distressing events. Initial analyses will focus on the success of randomization to groups. The investigators will examine group differences on possible covariates (e.g., demographic variables) and those that are different across conditions will be used as covariates. Preliminary analyses will examine distributional properties of primary outcome measures and correlations among outcome measures and possible covariates. The investigators will set alpha at .05 for all analyses of primary hypotheses. To examine the influence of psychiatric symptoms (compared to the HR) on primary outcomes, the investigators will examine the relationship between baseline clinically relevant psychiatric variables (e.g., symptom severity) and changes in SUDS, emotional arousal, and clinical outcomes over time and if appropriate include these variables in primary analyses. Full data analytic plans are described in the full protocol.","brief_title":"Evaluating a Novel Method of Generalizing Emotion Regulation","detailed_description":"Difficulties regulating emotional arousal in a skillful manner are common across many psychiatric disorders and may be central to some of the most severe and difficult-to-treat populations (e.g., borderline personality disorder). To immediately decrease negative affect, individuals who have difficulties regulating negative emotions often rely on maladaptive behaviors that are significant public health problems, including substance use, suicidal behavior, binging/purging, and other negatively reinforced behavior. Conventional approaches to generalization of emotion regulation skills outside the clinic (e.g., assigning therapy homework) are insufficient. New interventions are needed that directly and immediately reduce acute negative emotions and do not rely on patient compliance with homework assignments or other top-down approaches. Accordingly, the primary aim of this project is to evaluate whether novel habituation reminders (HRs) introduced following personally-relevant emotional stressors reduce acute negative emotions and psychological distress outside of an original learning context. Using a team of basic and applied scientists, over 4 years investigators will recruit 420 adult outpatients to enroll 250 participants who have extreme difficulties with emotion regulation to participate in 3 experiments. Actual enrollment: 372 adult outpatients signed consent and enrolled into the study. 222 participants were eligible and began the study. Out of the 222, 210 completed the study (as opposed to the desired 250). Before being recruited into the study, potential participants will complete a phone screen—a pre-experiment screening questionnaire or an online questionnaire to assess certain exclusion and inclusion criteria. Eligible participants will be invited to the study office to provide written informed consent and receive a clinical assessment, during which full inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed. Using the method developed by Pitman and colleagues and used in studies of adults with PTSD, BPD, and other diagnoses, investigators will create four negative emotional arousal scripts that will be used in a random order during Exp. 1. In brief, the Clinical Assessor will ask the participant to describe five of the most recent (i.e., past two weeks) moderate stressors in their lives. Participants will write a description of each event, and the clinical assessor will work with the participant to establish a clear story for each event that can be recited in approximately 30 seconds. The assessor will then review the script, ask for any clarification, and then ask the participant to rank them from most to least stressful. Following the assessment, the clinical assessor or same sex experimenter will digitally record these scripts into .mp3 files, which will be used in random order as the emotional stressors in Exp. 1. Experiment 1 -Design-In Exp. 1, the investigators will use a 2 (Learning Phase: HR v. No HR) X 2 (Testing Phase: Context same v. different) X 2 (Testing Phase: HR v. No HR) between-subjects factorial design. Randomization-All participants will be randomized to condition, with oversampling for HR groups, by using an urn randomization procedure by the off-site study statistician. Urn randomization will be conducted using age and gender as matching variables. Learning Phase (Day 1)Baseline-First, baseline subjective units of general psychological distress (SUDS; visual analogue scale from 0-100) and emotional arousal will be assessed using self-reported and psychophysiological (galvanic skin response) measures. The Study Coordinator will affix electrodes using standard procedures, and will use Biopac MP150 hardware and AcKnowledge software for data acquisition. The galvanic skin response device is not being tested for safety or efficacy in this study, and is not being used as a diagnostic device. Participants will complete a five-minute baseline, sitting in a comfortable chair quietly without sleeping in a temperature controlled, sound attenuated room. SUDS and self-reported baseline emotion (SAM) will be obtained at the end of baseline. Next, the emotional stressor task will be administered to all participants by playing a stressful script which was created during the clinical assessment. Prior to hearing the script, participants will be instructed to listen carefully and to attempt to imagine the event as vividly as possible. The task proceeds as follows: (1) the stressor will be heard via headphones (30s), (2) participants are instructed via standardized instructions to imagine as vividly as possible the stressful experience (30s), (3) silence (30s), (3) self-report of emotional arousal and valence (SAM; 30s) will be obtained via a computer. This sequence will repeat a minimum of two and a maximum of four times, until habituation has occurred (return to mean baseline arousal). Habituation will be continuously monitored using a real-time monitoring program currently being used in the lab that samples arousal (GSR) every 500ms relative to the average baseline arousal. This method allows idiographic analyses of habituation to the stressor, and ensures that the HR is administered during habituation. Individuals who continue to have high levels of emotional arousal after completing the emotional stressor task will be asked to sit in silence for 10 more minutes (receiving the SAM every 120 seconds), and if habituation has yet to occur, they will be prompted to focus on their breath to help with relaxation for the next 10 minutes. Based on findings using this emotional stressor task suggesting that habituation occurs within 3 minutes for veterans with PTSD, the investigators are confident that the approach will result in habituation. Once habituation occurs, the HR will be heard via headphones 3 times (for a total of 6s) by participants randomized to hear the HR, whereas the No-HR participants will hear nothing. The HR will be a series of neutral novel sounds lasting 6s, and will be the same series of sounds being used in current lab ongoing studies testing extinction reminders. After the HR is played, the Study Coordinator will use standardized instructions to tell participants to remember this sound as a reminder of calming down. Lastly, SUDS and self-reported emotional arousal measure will be assessed (SAM). Physiological data will be continuously measured throughout this period. Although it is not expected to occur frequently, data from participants who do not habituate will not be used in analyses, and additional participants run. After completing the stressor task, there will be a 15 minute break, followed by a second and third administration of the stressor task using the procedures outlined above, but with a different personalized stressor recording each time. Investigators will randomize the order of the recordings that the participants described during the clinical assessment. At the end of the third emotional stressor task, participants will be scheduled for their Testing Phase one week later. Testing Phase (Day 2)-One week after the Learning Phase, participants will complete the Testing Phase for Exp. 1. Upon arrival, half of the participants will be randomly assigned to be tested in the original laboratory room from the Learning Phase (same room as Day 1) and the other half to a new room. In line with the investigators' previous learning studies using context manipulations, the new room in the Testing Phase will represent a very different context compared to the room from the Learning Phase. The novel testing room will have different size, lighting, and furniture. Using a scent machine, the novel room will have the smell of mint released during testing. In addition, to ensure that the experimenter does not function as a reminder of habituation from the Learning Phase, testing in the novel room will be done by a different experimenter than in the original Learning Phase. In both the original and novel testing rooms, the Testing Phase will begin with a baseline (same procedures as above). Next, a new recording of a personally relevant stressor will be played (same procedures as in Learning Phase). Participants in both rooms will be randomly assigned to hear the HR or hear nothing (No HR). The HR will be presented through headphones every 10 seconds after the onset of the stressor task. Measures of psychological distress and emotional arousal will be obtained (same procedures as in the Learning Phase). As in the Learning Phase, after 10 minutes or when habituation occurs as operationalized above, the stressor will end and self-reported psychological distress and emotional arousal will be assessed. Experiment 2 -In both the original and novel testing rooms, the Testing Phase will begin with a baseline (same procedures as above). Next, a new recording of a personally relevant stressor will be played (same procedures as in Learning Phase). Participants in both rooms will be randomly assigned to hear the HR or hear nothing (No HR). The HR will be presented through headphones every 10 seconds after the onset of the stressor task. Measures of psychological distress and emotional arousal will be obtained (same procedures as in the Learning Phase). As in the Learning Phase, after 10 minutes or when habituation occurs as operationalized above, the stressor will end and self-reported psychological distress and emotional arousal will be assessed. Because groups 5 and 7 from Exp. 1 will have only heard the HR during the Testing Phase, and it may therefore be associated with the emotional stressor but not habituation, these participants will not be randomized into Exp. 2. The participants in Exp. 2 will be randomized to either hear the HR or a sham sound delivered via the automated server and cellular phone platform when negative emotions are endorsed. The result is a 2 (Day 1 HR v. No HR) X 2 (Phone HR v. sham sound) Latin square experimental design. Procedure. At the conclusion of Exp. 1, the Clinical Assessor will orient participants to Exp. 2. Over the next week, participants receive eight calls each day (approximately one call every two waking hours), with each call lasting 1-2 minutes. For both experimental conditions (HR v. Sham), calls on the first day will be used to establish baseline levels of psychological distress (SUDS; 0-9), emotional valence (positive vs. negative; 1-9 scale; endpoints from the SAM used) and strength of emotional arousal (1-9; SAM), while no HRs will be delivered. On all other days, when participants report high emotional arousal (i.e., >4) and low valence (i.e., negative affect; <5), they will automatically hear the HR or sham sound based on randomization to Exp. 2 condition. The sham sound will be a series of neutral percussive sounds unrelated to the HR in form but equivalent on other relevant parameters (e.g., amplitude, length). After the HR or sham sound, all participants will provide self-reported psychological distress (SUDS) and emotional valence/arousal, in order to evaluate differential changes due to the HR or sham sound. After one week, participants will return to the laboratory to return the phone, receive compensation, and be debriefed. To further evaluate clinically meaningful changes due to the HR, the experimenter will collect pre-, and post-Exp. 2 assessments of symptoms of clinical outcome measures (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and depression When beginning Exp. 2, information will be given on how to use the phone (with hands-free headset), keep its battery charged, and how to call study staff. Phones will be restricted to study-related access and emergency numbers only. All calls will be conducted using a dedicated server and existing software in the lab. The software uses automated dialing and recorded prompts that ask participants to provide ratings on the phone keypad. First, to mitigate the possibility that the phone will be stolen, sold, or not used, the Study Coordinator and participants will create a plan to use the phone. Second, self-report scales will be the same as those from Exp. 1. Third, calls will be during times that the patient will normally be awake. No participant identifying information will be accessible in the cell phone. All data from the phone are stored in real-time in a password-protected computer in the lab. Experiment 3 -The primary aim of Exp. 3 is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect size estimates of a self-initiated HR (n = 50. on psychological distress and acute negative emotions by hearing the HRs over two weeks. Investigators will examine: (1) frequency of calls in to hear the HR within and across participants at times in their daily life when they are having acute negative emotions, and (2) how laboratory HR training affects psychological distress and emotional arousal/valence in naturalistic settings over time. Procedures. At the conclusion of Exp. 1, the Clinical Assessor will orient participants to Exp. 3. Participants will be asked to call the automated server during the next two weeks when they are feeling acute negative emotions. To facilitate use of the HR, the assessor will discuss expected upcoming stressful events, in particular those that occur daily or frequently, and explain how the phone can be used to cope with these stressful or emotionally arousing situations. Participants will also be told that they will receive three automated calls a day, beginning the next day. During the 2 week period, participants calling in to the lab will hear a brief greeting and an assessment of present SUDS, emotional arousal and valence. If the participant indicates emotional arousal >4 and valence < 5, the automated system will ask if they would like to hear the HR. If the participant does not meet these requirements or indicates that they do not want to hear the HR, they will instead hear a brief message thanking them for calling in. After the HR or thank you message, all participants will then be again asked to report SUDS, emotional arousal and valence, after which the call will end. The procedure for calls out will be identical to Exp. 2, except that all participants will receive 3 calls a day, have access to the HRs, and be able to choose whether to hear the HR. After two weeks, participants will return to the lab, give back the cell phone, complete an exit interview, and receive compensation. Exp. 3 compliance enhancement strategies are the same as in Exp. 2, except for the incentive structure. Interviews-Diagnostic exclusions and current/past prevalence of Axis I and II diagnoses will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for Mental Disorders-I and II. Intelligence Quotient (IQ) will be assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—Third Edition (PPVT-III). The Treatment History Interview (THI)will be used to assess previous and ongoing psychiatric services received. The THI will be administered at pre- and post-experiment time points. All interviews will be videotaped, and investigators will determine the reliability of every tenth interview. Exit interviews will be conducted at the end of Exp. 3 to assess participants' acceptability of the HR. Physiological Measurement-Skin conductance will be measured using Ag-AgCl electrodes on the middle phalanx of the middle and ring fingers of the participant's non-dominant hand. The electrodes will be connected to a Biopac MP150 device in an adjacent room. Amplified signals of analog data are converted to digital form and filtered using Biopac's AcKnowledge Software, and are stored in a database on the computer. Biochemical measures-Urinalyses (UA's) are conducted at diagnostic intake to rule out participants currently taking illicit or prescription substances known to affect psychophysiological arousal. The specimens will be screened on-site using the Biosite Triage Meter Plus.. Urine will be tested for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, methadone, amphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Results will be available within 30 minutes.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","brief_summary":"The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of helicobacter pylori eradication on liver fat content, liver function tests, lipid profile, homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) index, and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference)in non-diabetic subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","brief_title":"Helicobacter Pylori Eradication in Non-diabetic Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis","detailed_description":"Helicobacter pylori (HP) antigens have been found in the liver of individuals with benign and malignant liver diseases.

Phase I is a qualitative study exploring the experience of primary caregivers of patients with a new diagnosis of malignant brain tumor during the first 10 weeks of the diagnosis and beginning treatment process. During Phase I, only caregivers patients with a malignant brain tumor who are at least two months and not more than six months into treatment at the Seidman Cancer Center (SCC)will be enrolled. They will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview to describe the newly diagnosed experience (diagnosis through first 10 weeks of treatment) of having a loved one with a malignant brain tumor. A convenience sample of 20 patients and their primary caregivers will be enrolled for Phase II of this pilot project. The first ten patients and caregivers enrolled will receive usual care (Phase II, Arm A). Usual care is defined as standard post-operative care on a surgical unit in University Hospitals Case Medical Center. Discharge planning will be provided by the assigned in-patient social worker. Referrals to the assigned outpatient social worker will be made as appropriate. Patients and caregivers will be seen in the ambulatory medical oncology setting about three to six weeks after surgery, depending on post-operative recovery time.

Hepatitis C is the most frequently encountered liver condition in this population. Both diseases allow a higher level of poisonous substances (toxins) normally produced by the bacteria present in the gut to enter the bloodstream. This leads to a chronic inflammatory state, which results in faster development of liver scars (fibrosis) and ultimately, end stage disease (cirrhosis). To prevent this from happening, the use of antibiotics has been attempted to reduce the quantity of gut flora in the hopes of lowering the amount of toxins produced. These trials have shown promising results, but the antibiotics studied had major side effects and were not designed for continuous use. Rifaximin is a non absorbable antibiotic with very few side effects. It is already used for long periods of time in cirrhotic patients to treat the effects of cirrhosis on the brain (encephalopathy). This project will try to determine if rifaximin, by reducing the level of toxins produced by the bacteria in the gut, can improve the evolution of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with hepatitis C. In this pilot study, ten patients with HIV and HCV infection will be followed for one year. In addition, 10 patients with HCV mono infection will also be followed. Both populations will be included if they are starting on rifaximin, for its currently approved FDA indication (hepatic encephalopathy).","brief_title":"Impact of an Antibiotic (Rifaximin) on Liver Scarring in HIV-Infected Patients With Liver Disease","detailed_description":"Many studies have already proved the deleterious effects of LPS on HIV and hepatic diseases evolution.

We hypothesize that it could help to slow down the progression of liver disease at any stage in these patients. This is a pilot study. A total of twenty patients placed on rifaximin by their physician for a mild hepatic encephalopathy will be monitored over a period of one year. The evaluation of the fibrosis will be done through transient elastography every 3 months. Bacterial translocation will be evaluated through the dosing of soluble CD14.

The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and neurological disease to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery. Many patients have a reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat (pharynx) and this leads to an inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct manner. This can produce a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and fluids, regurgitation, aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life. Treatment of dysphagia is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education about safe swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid from entering the airway. One of the most widely accepted treatments of dysphagia is to alter the texture of food. Most patients with dysphagia will have more difficulty swallowing thin liquids. By adding a thickener to the liquid, a food bolus becomes more cohesive, and is less likely to become aspirated. Various types of thickening products are available over-the-counter without a prescription. These thickening products are bland and currently have no flavor. The investigators hypothesize that alterations in food taste (sweet, salty, etc…), viscosity will improve swallowing efficiency. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effects of food taste, texture on swallowing efficiency. The goal is to develop safer, better tasting food products and improve the quality of life in patients with disabling swallowing disorders.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Genotype 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Infection","brief_summary":"Hypothesis Combination of Boceprevir with Ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C infection will increase the proportion of patients achieving sustained viral response compared to standard treatment alone.","brief_title":"Boceprevir With Peginterferon Alfa-2b and Ribavirin in the Treatment-naive Patients Infected With Genotype 4 Chronic Hepatitis C Infection","detailed_description":"Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Boceprevir 800 mg three times per day (TID) orally (PO) (hereafter called Boceprevir) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 μg/kg once per week (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based dosing (WBD) of ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg/day) compared to standard of care (SOC) (therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG)+ribavirin (RBV) WBD) in previously untreated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4 infection.

In addition to studying safety, Phase II clinical trials test if the investigational drug is effective and whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved CRLX101 for your type of cancer. Camptothecin is a chemical extracted from plants that is the basis for the standard FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and topotecan. Camptothecin works by interfering with the way cells divide and multiply. The investigational drug CRLX101 is a formulation of camptothecin and a large molecule (nanoparticle)that appears to allow more of the camptothecin to get into tumors and stay in tumors. The persistence of the CRLX101 in the tumor may increase the probability that the tumor cells will be damaged. CRLX101 has been well tolerated in the laboratory and in participants with different kinds of cancer. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor which has activity in many kinds of cancer. Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners. It has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 might have unique clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous inhibition of distinct steps along the HIF → (CAIX) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway.

The first arm of this line of research (PET scan) aims to investigate phasic DA release in MDD during incentive motivation. The investigators will utilize an established molecular imaging technique to measure striatal DA release dynamically during performance of testing and control versions of a monetary incentive delay task, which involves anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards. In doing so, this experiment will link together independent lines of research that have associated depression with decreased hedonic responsiveness, impaired reinforcement learning and dysfunctional DA transmission. We hypothesize that, relative to matched controls, unmedicated MDD subjects will show reduced reward-related ligand (11C-raclopride) displacement. Reduced ligand displacement will be interpreted as indicating reduced task-induced release of endogenous striatal DA in response to reward-predicting cues and unpredictable reward in MDD subjects. In the second arm of this research (EEG recording), the investigators aim to probe the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain mechanisms underlying positive and negative reinforcement learning in MDD and their relations to phasic DA. Participants will perform the probabilistic stimulus selection task (PSST) while event-related potentials (ERPs) are collected. The investigators expect that, relative to matched controls, unmedicated MDD subjects will show reduced positive reinforcement learning, potentiated negative reinforcement learning, and larger (i.e., more negative) feedback-related negativity (FRN) in response to positive reinforcement (indicative of reduced DA transmission). Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that a more negative FRN in response to positive reinforcement will be associated with decreased striatal raclopride displacement (i.e., lower release of endogenous DA) as measured by PET in the first part of the study.

Both medical yoga and exercise interventions were held in groups and included two sessions per week over six weeks. After the sixth week, participants were instructed to continue practicing at least twice a week on their own. In the medical yoga group, the participants received written information and a disk providing additional guidance. In the exercise therapy group, the participants received tailored written information on exercise. The third group, evidence-based self-care advice, was physically examined by experienced back pain experts (an orthopedic specialist and a licensed chiropractor), and received an oral recommendation to stay active and a booklet containing evidenced-based self-care advice. The participants were randomized to one of these three treatment groups after undergoing the initial examination and receiving the evidence-based information on self-care and staying active. The form of randomization was block randomization using the pre-randomization technique, in which for each participant an opaque envelope was picked, in consecutive order, by an external research assistant who had no contact with the participants. After randomization the back pain specialist met with the participants and gave them background information about the intervention they were being offered. Previous studies [19, 20] have shown that expectations of treatment and response levels differ depending on, whether the treatment is physically or psychologically oriented. Therefore, the two training interventions (yoga and exercise therapies) were both presented as well established training therapies, to improve the level of participation and to equalize the participants' expectations of the treatment and its outcomes. After the assignment of study participants to intervention groups, the statistician who performed the analyses on the intervention outcomes was \"blinded\".

Although the last two decades have resulted in an explosion in our understanding of the biological mechanisms of reward, establishing the relevance of this knowledge to the addictive process has been problematic. Most importantly, this information has been of limited utility in offering new pharmacologic treatment approaches to addicted patients - particularly those with cocaine addiction. Over the past 15 years our laboratory has published multiple studies using pharmacologic probes to explore the biologic underpinnings of cocaine addiction using single photon emissions computerized tomography (SPECT) technology. More recently, however, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has offered several advantages over SPECT and is now a favored approach, e.g. fMRI allows the continuous measurement of neural responses rather than a very limited time period with SPECT (1-3 minutes every 48 hours). Using fMRI [including both ASL (Arterial Spin Labeling) and fcMRI (functional connectivity], the neural response can be measured throughout the 60 min that follows infusion, allowing identification and capture of the maximal brain response period that may occur at any time during this 60 min. In the proposed study, we will assess the brain response to two of the probes (scopolamine and lidocaine) we have previously studied with SPECT.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Ovarian Cancer","brief_summary":"The purpose of this study is to determine if weekly chemotherapy (i.e. giving paclitaxel or carboplatin at a lower dose every week) is more effective than standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin given once every three weeks over 18 weeks) in treating ovarian cancer.

Thus in this study, we conducted the prospective study to compare urgent VCE with urgent DBE in patients with massive overt OGIB. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield between urgent VCE and urgent DBE in patients with massive overt OGIB. Patients and Methods Patients Between October 2010 and March 2012, patients referred to a tertiary, King Memorial Chulalongkorn University Hospital to evaluate GIB. The consecutive patients with massive overt OGIB defined as a visible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (eg, melena or hemotochezia) of unknown origin that persists after an initial negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were recruited. Massive was defined as the need for at least 3 units of blood transfusion. All patients underwent an EGD and colonoscopy within the first 48 hrs of hospitalization. In case that the causes of gastrointestinal bleeding had not been identified, informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, patients with a suspected intestinal obstruction or stricture, cardiac pacemaker implantation or other electromedical device implantation, diabetic gastroparesis, a history of gastrectomy and small bowel surgery. This study was a prospective study comparing between urgent VCE and urgent DBE. VCE and DBE were performed within the first 72 hrs of hospitalization. VCE was carried out 12 hrs before DBE. The independent operators performed VCE and DBE. The VCE results were blinded to the DBE endoscopists. A positive finding was considered that finding could explain the cause of bleeding and/or resulted in a correct therapeutic management including taking biopsy sampling. A negative finding was considered when the cause of bleeding was not detected and there was no recurrence of bleeding during the follow up period. The results of CE and DBE were evaluated whether or not the total small bowel was visualization. The diagnosis yield and the impact on clinical outcome were assessed. CE procedure CE was performed at the bedside according to the manufacturer's instruction (MiroCam, Intromedic Co., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The technical description of CE has been documented.8 The capsule has a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor with an image acquisition rate of 3 frames per second. As a result of a power saving measure, the recorder incorporates two external electrodes and a single skin electrode for electric data conduction across the body which avoids the need for radiofrequency transmission.8 Patients ingested 2L of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for small bowel preparation. Patients were allowed to drink clear liquid at 2 hrs after swallowing the capsule. No any medication (prokinetic drugs, simethicone) was given during the examination. The small bowel transit time was defined as the time between the passage of the capsule through the pylorus and the arrival of the capsule in the cecum. The boundary between the jejunum and ileum was defined as the half-time of small bowel transit. 9 The positive finding on VCE were defined as either the visualization of a lesion including angioectasia, mass and ulcer or the presence of blood and/or blood clots in the small bowel lumen. The terms of negative findings were defined as no abnormalities or non-specific findings such as red spots, erosion and visible submucosal vein. DBE procedure The standard DBE system (Fujinon Inc, Saitama, Japan) was used in the examination. The system consists of the high resolution endoscope (Fujinon EN-450T5/20) with a 200-cm working length, 8.5 mm of outer diameter and a 145-cm flexible overtube with 12 mm of outer diameter. The endoscope's working channel has a 2.2 mm in diameter. Two latex balloons were attached at the tips of both the enteroscope and the overtube and were inflated and deflated with the air from a pressure controlled system. The technique has been described in the detail previously by Yamamoto et al.10 The initial oral approach was usually selected. Whilst, the anal approach was performed initially in patients suspected ileum lesion who presented with hematochezia. The anal approach was performed in the same session when the initial route was negative. In case that the other approach was considered, the small bowel mucosa was marked by submucosal India ink injection using injection catheter at the most distal part during the oral approach and the most proximal part during the anal approach. DBE was performed under conscious sedation with midazolam and/or meperidine administration and cardiorespiratory monitoring by the experience endoscopists. If the bleeding cause was detected, the endoscopic treatment was used to achieve hemostasis including argon plasma coagulation (APC), injection or clipping. Biopsy was taken whenever possible. In case that tumor was found, India ink was marked into submucosa around it.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Obese","brief_summary":"BACKGROUND: The nascent field of mobile health (mHealth) is expanding with impressive speed. In March 2012, experts estimated that 40,000 health related smartphone applications were on the market but little is known about the effectiveness of these programs. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether weight loss can be successfully achieved through use of a smartphone application or how these applications could be used in primary care practice. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a popular, free smartphone application for weight loss and calorie counting in a primary care setting. METHODS: The first phase of this study involved a community based participatory approach to select the intervention. Patient focus groups were conducted and analyzed to explore patients' preferences regarding various text-message versus smartphone programs. The second phase of this study, described here, will be a randomized controlled trial with overweight primary care patients exposed to one of two conditions for 6 months: (1) usual care; (2) usual care plus smartphone application, which includes instructing participants on how to use the application and encouraging them to use the applications' reminders and social networking features. The primary outcome of interest is weight change at 3 and 6 months. Two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare weight change between groups, as appropriate. ANCOVA models will be used to examine weight change after adjusting for covariates such as education, sex and age. Repeated measures analysis will be carried out to compare weight change between the groups using baseline, 3 month and 6 month data. In addition to an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigators will also conduct a \"treatment received\" analysis, adjusting for the extent of application use in both the intervention and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: This study will demonstrate whether a smartphone application introduced in primary care settings and incorporated into the visit can produce weight loss. Study findings could inform a national discourse on the value of smartphone applications in routine clinical practice.","brief_title":"mFit: The Mobile Fitness Project","detailed_description":"NOT FOUND","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","brief_summary":"TITLE : Circulating tumor cells identification in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (CIRCUBRONCH) BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cells identification is a new field of research in oncology, and some studies have been conducted with success on breast and prostate cancer.

A newer imaging technique, whole body Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) uses the idea that inflammatory cells take up sugar to locate inflammation in the body. Because patients with PsA have inflammatory cells in their joints and tendons, this type of scan allows the physician to take a picture of the whole body and locate inflammation. The investigators have found that some patients with psoriasis (but without arthritis) have inflammation in joints and tendons even before the patient has symptoms. In this study, the investigators will explore how well PET/CT works for assessing inflammation in patients with PsA. This would be a very exciting tool that could be used to find and treat inflammation before it causes damage or pain.","brief_title":"PET/CT in Psoriatic Arthritis","detailed_description":"NOT FOUND","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Rectal Prolapse","brief_summary":"The aim of the study is to compare Delorme operation alone or with post anal repair and levatorplasty for treating complete rectal prolapse.consecutive patients who were treated for complete rectal prolapse at the Colorectal Surgery Unit were eligible for the study.The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I: consisted of patients were subjected to delorme operation only.

Patients usually present with obstructed defecation or fecal incontinence. This study is to compare Delorme operation alone or with post anal repair and levatorplasty for treating complete rectal prolapse. Consecutive patients who were treated for complete rectal prolapse at our Colorectal Surgery Unit were eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria include pregnant female, any patients with previous anal surgery, pudendal nerve neuropathy, anal fistula and sepsis or coagulopathy. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, proctoscopic examination, and sigmoidoscopy. Anorectal physiology studies consisted of anal manometry and measurement of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) to exclude pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. Patients enrolled in the study were randomized into three groups using the closed envelope method. The envelopes were drawn and opened by a nurse not otherwise engaged in the study in the operating room. The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I: consisted of patients were subjected to delorme operation only. Group II: consisted of patients were subjected to delorme operation with post anal repair and levatorplasty.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Children's Dental Anxiety","brief_summary":"Pharmacological interventions to aid behavior management's techniques are commonly used in pediatric dentistry. The aim of the medicaments is to control behavior and allow safe completion of a dental procedure. Homeopathic remedy is safe and can be effective to control behavior and decrease anxiety in children during dental treatment. Aim: 1. To explore the efficacy of homeopathic drugs in decreasing children's dental anxiety before dental treatment. 2. To assess the effectiveness of homeopathic remedy in facilitating dental treatment for anxious children. Methods: prospective, double-blind study. Thirty healthy children (5-12 years-old) will receive homeopathic remedy\\placebo before dental treatment. Anxiety reduction will be measured using: saliva cortisol levels, saliva α-amylase levels, facial image scale (FIS), and Houpt behavior scale. Expected results: the homeopathic remedy will reduce anxiety and increase child cooperation during dental treatment.","brief_title":"Reducing Children's Anxiety Using Homeopathic Remedy Before Dental Treatment","detailed_description":"NOT FOUND","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Pulmonary Hypertension: Efficacy of Rehabilitation","brief_summary":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to impaired physical condition (PC), body composition (BC) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Specific pharmacological treatment and - in selected patients, refractory to agents - lung or combined heart and lung transplantation can improve physical functioning and long term survival. Initial trials with limited numbers of patients were encouraging. Investigation of larger cohorts is essential to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation programmes in PH. We hypothesize that a 3 week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves PC, BC and HRQOL in patients with PH in functional classes (FC) II and III. Critical ill patients with a functional class IV are excluded. All patients with PH undergo a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation program (interval bicycle and strength training, physiotherapy, psychological support, education). Exercise testing (peak work load (PWL) 6-min-walk distance), body composition (bioimpedance analysis BIA: lean body mass (LBM), body cell mass (BCM), BCM/LBM ratio, phase angle (PA)) and HRQOL (SF 36 questionnaire) are assessed at baseline and completion of PR.","brief_description":"NOT FOUND"},{"condition":"Non Small-cell Lung Cancer","brief_summary":"Randomized study in 2 arms, without any masking in patients with non small cell lung cancer, histologically or cytologically confirmed, not liable to surgery, stage IIIB or IIIA, according to the TNM classification of the American Joint Committee for cancer.
